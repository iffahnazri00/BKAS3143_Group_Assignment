# Sacred Stitch Trendy and Hip Online (SSTHO) - PHP - 2021

## Overview

It is an honor for every developer to create a software that can asist users in their daily life. Therefore, we from Group 3 BKAS3143_B had created an e-commerce website namely Sacred Stich Trendy and Hip Online (SSTHO) website with the reference of project that been created by CodeAstro from the website of **CodeAstro**. This website is used to help all business out there to run their business effectively and well-organized especially for those business in the fashion industry. 

There are a lot of programming languages that a developer can use, however, this website is more focuses on **PHP**. Therefore, we had use **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **JavaScript** and **AJAX** in developing this application.  

First and foremost, we had created `index.php` file, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of SSTHO instructions had been built in this file. **PHP** had been use to format the webpages as it is a powerful tool for making a dynamic and interactive webpages. 

However, **PHP** is quite limited in designing department. Hence, we had use **CSS** which is the **Cascading Style Sheets** together with the **Bootstrap** and **JavaScript**  to add specific fonts, colours, and a few elements that can make the website looks more visual dynamic.

There are a few challenges that I entitle during developing this application and the one that I would like to focus is on generating a responsive website by using **Bootstrap**.
